Priya: Alright everyone, thanks for joining. Let's get started with the incident post-mortem.

Priya: That's too slow. We need to tune those thresholds.
John: Do we know what triggered it?
Neha: So let's go through what happened during yesterday's outage.
John: The alert fired but it was delayed by about 10 minutes.
Neha: Agreed. No blame here just looking for improvements.
Priya: The database ran out of connections around 3 PM.
Charlie: Yes. We clearly need better connection pooling.
Amit: Yeah there was a batch job that wasn't releasing connections properly.
Neha: How long were we down?
Amit: What about monitoring? Did we get alerted?
John: This is the second time this has happened right?

Amit: We'll implement connection pooling across all services.
John: Alert thresholds will be reviewed and tightened.

Amit: Priya, can you create the ticket for connection pooling.
Priya: Got it, I'll take care of that.
John: Amit, please document this incident in the runbook.
Amit: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Charlie: Neha, will you review the alert configuration.
Neha: Got it, I'll take care of that.

Charlie: Perfect. I'll send out the meeting notes.
