Neha: Alright everyone, thanks for joining. Let's get started with the vendor evaluation.

Alice: That would take too long. Maybe just the top two.
David: AWS seems like the obvious choice for features.
Neha: Agreed. AWS and Azure seem like the finalists.
Neha: They also have the best hybrid cloud story.
Alice: What about Google Cloud? Their pricing is more transparent.
David: The support has been hit or miss though.
Eve: True but they're also the most expensive.
Alice: Price, support quality, and migration assistance.
Eve: Azure offers good enterprise features.

Eve: We'll do POCs with AWS and Azure only.
Neha: Final decision will be made by end of month.

David: Alice, can you set up the POC environments.
Alice: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Alice: David, please get detailed quotes from both vendors.
David: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Alice: Eve, will you prepare the evaluation matrix.
Eve: Got it, I'll take care of that.

Eve: Alright that's a wrap. Thanks everyone.
