Amit: Alright everyone, thanks for joining. Let's get started with the travel planning.

Priya: Bangalore might be easier since most of the team is already there.
Alice: Let me check flight prices and get back to you.
Amit: Have we decided on a location yet?
David: That should be enough if we book early.
Alice: I'd say three days. We have a lot to cover.
Amit: I was thinking Bangalore or maybe Pune. Both have good venues.
Priya: We have about two lakhs for the whole thing including travel.
Bob: Should we do two days or three?

David: We're going with Pune for the offsite.
Bob: It will be a three day event in the second week of next month.

Alice: Amit, can you book the conference room at the Pune office.
Amit: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Amit: Alice, please send out the travel survey to the team.
Alice: Got it, I'll take care of that.
David: Alice, will you get quotes from the travel agency.
Alice: Got it, I'll take care of that.

Amit: Great meeting. Talk to you all soon.
