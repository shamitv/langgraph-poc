Alice: Alright everyone, thanks for joining. Let's get started with the client meeting.

Charlie: The format of the exported reports. CSV or PDF?
Charlie: So the development is progressing well. We're about a week ahead of schedule.
Charlie: Absolutely. That's easy to add.
Alice: Can we do both? Different users have different needs.
Charlie: Perfect. What about the mobile version?
Rahul: What specifically?
Charlie: That's on track for phase two. Should have a prototype next month.
Rahul: The only thing is we need some clarification on the reporting requirements.
Alice: Excellent. Keep up the good work.

Rahul: Reports will support both CSV and PDF exports.
Charlie: Mobile prototype will be ready by next month.

Alice: John, can you update the requirements document with the export formats.
John: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Charlie: John, please send the client the updated timeline.
John: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Alice: John, will you schedule the next progress review.
John: Got it, I'll take care of that.

Charlie: Perfect. I'll send out the meeting notes.
