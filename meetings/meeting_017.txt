Bob: Alright everyone, thanks for joining. Let's get started with the marketing strategy.

Bob: What's our target audience?
John: Should we focus on social media or email?
Charlie: Let's also do a blog post explaining the benefits.
Priya: Do we have budget for paid ads?
Charlie: So we need to plan the launch campaign for the new feature.
Charlie: What about a webinar? Those work well for demos.
Bob: Primarily small business owners. They're our fastest growing segment.
Bob: That makes sense. Warm leads are more likely to convert.
Bob: I'll start drafting the content calendar.
Charlie: A small amount. Maybe focus on retargeting.

Charlie: We'll run a webinar as the main launch event.
John: Paid ads will focus on retargeting existing users.

Charlie: John, can you create the email campaign drafts.
John: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Charlie: Bob, please schedule the webinar date with the product team.
Bob: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Priya: John, will you prepare the social media content.
John: Got it, I'll take care of that.

John: Alright that's a wrap. Thanks everyone.
