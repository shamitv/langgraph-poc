Priya: Alright everyone, thanks for joining. Let's get started with the sprint demo.

John: Can you show us the filtering feature?
John: Okay so this is the new dashboard we've been working on.
Priya: Is this ready for production or do we need more testing?
Neha: How long did that take to implement?
John: Great work team, this is exactly what we needed.
Neha: Yes, we added validation for that. Let me show you.
John: About three days, the API integration was tricky.
Neha: That looks really good. Did you handle the edge case we discussed?
Neha: Nice! The stakeholders are going to love this.
John: Yeah sure, so when you click here... um... the dropdown appears and you can filter by date.
Neha: So let me share my screen and walk you through what we built this sprint.
Neha: We still need QA to sign off but the core functionality is complete.

Priya: Alright so we're agreeing to deploy this to staging tomorrow.
Priya: Let's plan the production release for next Thursday.

John: Neha, can you update the release notes before end of day.
Neha: Got it, I'll take care of that.
John: Priya, please schedule a quick demo with the product team.
Priya: Got it, I'll take care of that.
John: Neha, will you run the performance tests one more time.
Neha: Got it, I'll take care of that.

Neha: Perfect. I'll send out the meeting notes.
