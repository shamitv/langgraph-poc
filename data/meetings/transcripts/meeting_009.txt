Priya: Alright everyone, thanks for joining. Let's get started with the quarterly planning.

Amit: We might need to bring in one more mobile developer.
Eve: That's aggressive. Do we have the resources?
Amit: Agreed. What can we deprioritize?
Priya: The mobile app is the revenue driver so that has to be first.
Rahul: I'm concerned we're taking on too much.
Charlie: From a product perspective we need to launch the mobile app.
Priya: Alright let's align on the goals for next quarter.
Rahul: Fair point. Let's prioritize ruthlessly.
Charlie: That makes sense. It's not customer facing anyway.
Eve: What about the infrastructure improvements we discussed?
Amit: Maybe push the admin dashboard redesign to next quarter.

Amit: Mobile app launch is the top priority for next quarter.
Eve: Admin dashboard redesign is moved to Q2.

Charlie: Eve, can you update the quarterly OKRs document.
Eve: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Eve: Charlie, please work with HR on the new role opening.
Charlie: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Priya: Eve, will you schedule the kickoff meeting for the mobile project.
Eve: Got it, I'll take care of that.

Eve: Thanks everyone. Have a good rest of your day.
