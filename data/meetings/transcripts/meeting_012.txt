Priya: Alright everyone, thanks for joining. Let's get started with the budget review.

Bob: Barely. People have been too busy to take courses.
Priya: Any unexpected expenses we should know about?
Neha: How much is that?
Bob: I'll send a reminder to the team.
Priya: We've spent about 70 percent so far.
Neha: Let's look at where we are with the quarterly budget.
Priya: About fifty thousand. It's already accounted for.
Priya: What about the training budget? Any utilization there?
Priya: Most of it was the new server infrastructure.
Priya: That seems high. We're only halfway through the quarter.

Bob: We'll push the team to use the training budget.
Bob: No changes needed to the budget allocation.

Priya: Bob, can you send a reminder about the training budget.
Bob: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Priya: Bob, please prepare the mid-quarter budget report.
Bob: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Priya: Bob, will you confirm the license renewal amount.
Bob: Got it, I'll take care of that.
