David: Alright everyone, thanks for joining. Let's get started with the training session.

David: GitFlow uses long-lived feature branches while trunk-based uses short-lived ones.
Amit: Those go directly to main with expedited review.
Rahul: Are we covering branching strategies today?
Charlie: Makes sense. Can you show us an example?
Rahul: How do we handle releases then?
Rahul: Which one do we use here?
Rahul: We use release tags instead of release branches.
David: We're moving towards trunk-based for faster iterations.

Amit: The team will adopt trunk-based development.
Rahul: Release tags will replace release branches.

Rahul: Amit, can you share the training slides with the team.
Amit: Got it, I'll take care of that.
John: David, please update the contributing guidelines.
David: Got it, I'll take care of that.
John: Rahul, will you schedule a follow-up Q&A session.
Rahul: Got it, I'll take care of that.

Rahul: Thanks everyone. Have a good rest of your day.
