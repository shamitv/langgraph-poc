John: Alright everyone, thanks for joining. Let's get started with the hiring discussion.

Alice: Fair point. What about the second candidate?
John: The third one was okay but seemed less experienced than the resume suggested.
David: What made you feel that way?
David: Yes let's set that up for early next week.
Amit: Just some of the answers about teamwork seemed... I don't know... rehearsed.
David: I agree. Her system design solution was impressive too.
David: Yeah but I'm a bit concerned about culture fit.
John: She was great. Good communication and asked really thoughtful questions.
Alice: I think so. Should we do a final round with the hiring manager?

John: We're moving forward with candidate two for final round.
David: We'll pass on candidates one and three.

Alice: John, can you send the rejection emails to the other candidates.
John: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Alice: David, please coordinate with HR for the final interview.
David: Got it, I'll take care of that.
David: Amit, will you prepare the salary discussion points.
Amit: Got it, I'll take care of that.

David: Perfect. I'll send out the meeting notes.
