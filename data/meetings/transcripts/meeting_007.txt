Eve: Alright everyone, thanks for joining. Let's get started with the architecture review.

David: What about the shared database? That's usually the tricky part.
Eve: It's relatively isolated and has clear boundaries.
John: We're looking at migrating from the monolith to microservices right?
David: That seems reasonable. What are the main risks?
Priya: Have you estimated the timeline?
John: We're planning to use the strangler pattern and slowly move data.
Priya: Definitely gradual. We'll start with the payment module.
David: Why payments first?
Priya: Correct. The current system is becoming hard to scale.

Eve: We'll proceed with the microservices migration starting with payments.
John: We'll use Kubernetes for orchestration.

John: Priya, can you document the API contracts for the payment service.
Priya: Got it, I'll take care of that.
Priya: John, please set up the new repository structure.
John: Got it, I'll take care of that.
David: Eve, will you schedule a deep dive session on the data migration.
Eve: Got it, I'll take care of that.

Eve: Good discussion. Let's reconvene next week.
